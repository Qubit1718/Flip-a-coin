#Flipping a coin using quantum computer

What if a quantum computer does the work for you when you decide to toss a coin to choose whom to bat first in a cricket match or who should make the first move in chess?

What if you want to know the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails when you flip a coin '2000' times? It seems impossible for a human to toss a coin 2000 times and take up the results each time and calculate the probability of getting heads or probability of getting tails. 

If these excite you, you are almost there to take a dive into the microscopic level of quantum universe. 

We shall use qiskit provided by IBM to do this experiment.
